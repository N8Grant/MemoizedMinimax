# MemoizedMinimax

This is an example of how memoization changes runtime from being exponential to polynomial. A Game of 3-Nim, a variation of regular Nim, is being played out do determine who has a winning strategy. In one function, the use of memoization is leveraged and in the other, only recursivity is used. The difference in running times is plotted in seconds for both methods. Memoization can be further sped up if identical states are recognized as having the same outcome.
